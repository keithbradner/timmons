# Develop Like Dever

An interactive 3D exhibit exploring the darkroom techniques of Dever Timmons, a 1930s pictorialist photographer known for his inspection development method.

## About

This exhibit demonstrates the difference between blind commercial film processing and Timmons' hands-on inspection technique. Users experience:

**Phase 1: The Machine Method** - Process a batch of 5 negatives using standard time-and-temperature routines with no individual control.

**Phase 2: The Artist's Eye** - Process each negative individually using Timmons' technique:
1. Desensitize in Pinakryptol Green forebath
2. Develop in near-total darkness
3. Briefly inspect under a dim green safelight to judge density
4. Stop development at the precise moment
